The game coordinate system works as follows:

== Physics ==
	= Units =
	Mass unit is Kilogram
	Dimension unit is meter

	= Coordinates =
	The X axis is perpindicular to gravity
	The Y axis is colinear to gravity
	Rotations are taken to be positive when the translate +X into +Y

== Rendering ==
	= Coordinates =
	Screen coordinates are relative to the viewport size
	The origin is on the lower left of the screen
	The +X axis extends from the origin to the right corner of the screen
	The +Y axis extends from the origin to the top of the screen 
	The +Z axis extends out of the screen (The coordinate system is right handed)
	Positive rotation about +Z translates +X into +Y
